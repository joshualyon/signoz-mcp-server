# TypeScript Fixes Session Notes

## What We Fixed

### Production Code Issues
1. **LogEntry timestamp flexibility**: Updated schema to accept both string and number timestamps
2. **Type assertions for API responses**: Added `as LogEntry[]` assertions where we know the API returns correct data
3. **Optional chaining for seriesData**: Fixed `seriesData?.values.get()` in formatters.ts

### Test File Issues
1. **Consistent optional chaining**: Applied `?.` operator throughout all test files for:
   - `builderQueries?.A`
   - `queryA?.filters?.items`
   - `filter?.[0]?.key.key`
   - etc.

2. **Test data corrections**:
   - Added `lastReceived` property to all MetricInfo test objects
   - Changed `'Counter'` to `'Sum'` (Counter is not a valid metric type)
   - Fixed timestamp formats in mock data

## Key Decisions

### Why Optional Chaining?
- Matches OpenAPI spec where these fields are genuinely optional
- Tests fail clearly when data is missing (e.g., expects 'level' but gets undefined)
- Consistent approach across all tests
- Easy to change globally if needed later

### Why Not Non-Null Assertions (!)?
- Would hide potential API contract violations
- Less safe - assumes our implementation always creates these fields
- Goes against the principle of testing the contract, not the implementation

## Important Type Insights

1. **CompositeQuery structure**: Only `queryType` and `panelType` are required
2. **BuilderQuery structure**: Only requires `queryName`, `stepInterval`, `dataSource`, `expression`
3. **Filters are optional**: A valid metrics query doesn't need filters
4. **Timestamps vary by data type**:
   - Metrics (Point): numeric timestamp
   - Logs (Row): string timestamp (but API often sends numbers anyway)

## Files Modified
- `/src/signoz/schemas.ts` - Updated LogEntry and Row schemas
- `/src/signoz/formatters.ts` - Added optional chaining
- `/src/signoz/index.ts` - Added type assertions
- `/test/*.test.ts` - Applied optional chaining consistently
- `/CHANGELOG.md` - Documented the fixes

This session ensures the codebase compiles cleanly with `bunx tsc --noEmit` and maintains type safety while being flexible enough to handle real-world API responses.
