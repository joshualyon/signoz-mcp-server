## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Complete automated release system with semantic versioning
- Cross-platform binary builds for all major platforms (macOS, Linux, Windows)
- Unified build script with flexible platform targeting
- Comprehensive development documentation and contributing guidelines
- Enhanced error handling for discover_metric_attributes with better validation
- Offset parameter support for discover_metrics tool - enables pagination through large metric lists

### Changed
- Improved type safety with proper import type statements
- Enhanced build system with better error handling and validation
- Updated documentation to reflect new release processes
- Redesigned discover_metrics output format to use information-dense markdown tables
- Updated discover_metrics to show ALL metrics (up to limit) instead of filtering to top 15 by activity
- Replaced verbose categorization with compact table format optimized for LLM consumption
- Increased default discover_metrics limit from 50 to 200 metrics
- Updated all example queries in metrics discovery to use standardized filter syntax instead of PromQL
- **BREAKING**: Renamed environment variable from `SIGNOZ_BASE_URL` to `SIGNOZ_API_URL` for consistency with `SIGNOZ_API_KEY`

### Fixed
- Build system reliability and cross-platform compatibility
- Query builder to properly handle `body~value` contains syntax - fixed incorrect attribute mapping for column fields
- discover_metrics pagination clarity - now shows total count and proper range indicators
- discover_metric_attributes validation to handle missing/invalid metrics properly
- Time range validation in query_metrics and query_logs - now catches backwards time ranges with helpful error messages
- Empty data series handling in metrics responses - provides clear diagnostics when queries return no data
- Timestamp unit validation warnings for potential seconds vs milliseconds confusion
- TypeScript compilation errors in production and test files - fixed type mismatches and added proper optional chaining
- LogEntry schema to accept both string and numeric timestamps matching actual API behavior
- Test data to include all required properties (lastReceived, proper type literals)

- Validation for query_metrics to handle empty metrics arrays gracefully
